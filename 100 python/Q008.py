# Description: Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a
#              comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
#
# Example: Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
#          without,hello,bag,world
#          Then, the output should be:
#          bag,hello,without,world






# terms = [term.strip(" ") for term in raw_input().split(',')]
# terms.sort()
# print(",".join(terms))
