# Description:  Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, you can read document online
#               or find some books. But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in functions.
#               Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, such as abs(), int(), raw_input()
#               And add document for your own function
